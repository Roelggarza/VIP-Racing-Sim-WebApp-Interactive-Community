# DNS Migration: Squarespace to Netlify for vipsimracing.com

## Current Situation
- Domain: vipsimracing.com
- Current: Pointing to Squarespace (showing parking page)
- Goal: Point to Netlify (your racing app)

## Step 1: Deploy to Netlify First
1. **In Bolt**: Click "Deploy" button
2. **Choose**: Netlify
3. **Wait**: For deployment to complete
4. **Get**: Your Netlify URL (something like `amazing-site-123.netlify.app`)

## Step 2: Add Custom Domain in Netlify
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Find your deployed site
3. Click "Domain settings"
4. Click "Add custom domain"
5. Enter: `vipsimracing.com`
6. Netlify will show you DNS records to update

## Step 3: Update DNS Records
You need to change these in your domain registrar (NOT Squarespace):

### Find Your Domain Registrar
Your domain was purchased from a registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
- Check your email for domain purchase receipts
- Try logging into common registrars with your email

### DNS Records to Update
Replace existing records with:
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank for root domain)  
Value: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify's load balancer)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-netlify-site.netlify.app
```

## Step 4: What About Squarespace?
- **Keep Squarespace active** until DNS fully propagates (24-48 hours)
- **Don't cancel** Squarespace immediately
- **You can cancel** Squarespace after confirming the new site works

## Step 5: Verification
- DNS changes take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- Test with: whatsmydns.net
- Enter: vipsimracing.com
- Should show Netlify IP addresses globally

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ **Don't delete Squarespace DNS** until new site is confirmed working
- ⚠️ **Keep Squarespace account** active during transition
- ✅ **Email settings** won't be affected if you have email elsewhere
- ✅ **SSL certificate** will be auto-generated by Netlify

## Timeline
- **Immediate**: Deploy to Netlify, add custom domain
- **Within 1 hour**: Update DNS records
- **24-48 hours**: Full DNS propagation
- **After confirmation**: Can cancel Squarespace

## Emergency Rollback
If something goes wrong:
1. Change DNS back to Squarespace
2. Wait for propagation
3. Fix issues and try again
