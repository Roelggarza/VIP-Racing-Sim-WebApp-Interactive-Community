# Version Control & Update Management

## Current Situation
- **Official Version**: This Bolt instance (for vipsimracing.com)
- **Development Versions**: Other Bolt instances with newer updates
- **Issue**: Updates not synced to official version

## Recommended Workflow Going Forward

### 1. Establish This as Master Version
- Make this the single source of truth
- All future updates should happen here
- Other instances should be considered development/testing only

### 2. Update Synchronization Process
1. **Identify Changes**: List all updates from other instances
2. **Prioritize Updates**: Critical fixes first, then features
3. **Implement Systematically**: One update at a time
4. **Test Thoroughly**: After each major change
5. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what was updated

### 3. Backup Strategy
- Download project files regularly
- Save to multiple locations (cloud storage, GitHub, etc.)
- Keep version history documentation
- Maintain deployment instructions

### 4. Future Development
- Use this instance for all production changes
- Test major updates in development environment first
- Keep staging and production versions clearly separated
- Regular backups before major updates

## Emergency Recovery Plan
If this version gets lost again:
1. Check browser downloads for ZIP backups
2. Look for GitHub repositories
3. Check cloud storage backups
4. Use backup documentation to recreate
5. Contact Bolt support if needed
